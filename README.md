What is Neoxa?
-----------------
Neoxa is a blockchain platform that combines gaming and cryptocurrency by allowing users to earn cryptocurrency while playing games. It operates on a Proof of Work mining system. The concept of "Play to Earn" enables gamers to engage with blockchain technology by playing games and receiving rewards. Neoxa aims to bridge the gap between the minable cryptocurrency and gaming communities, providing an opportunity for both to benefit from the blockchain. For more detailed information, please refer to the Neoxa whitepaper available at https://www.neoxa.net/whitepaper.

Neoxa is dedicated to providing gamers with the opportunity to earn Neoxa cryptocurrency while indulging in their favorite games. Our team consists of experienced developers who have a deep passion for gaming, and we are excited to introduce innovative features within our gaming servers. Leveraging the flexibility of PC Gaming and even console platforms, we can utilize modding to incorporate the necessary monitoring functionalities to bring our vision to life.

In contrast to numerous blockchain projects that lack realistic goals or fail to follow through with their plans, Neoxa stands apart by delivering a Proof of Concept right from its launch. We believe in demonstrating the feasibility of our ideas and ensuring tangible progress, earning the trust and confidence of our community.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/NeoxaChain/Neoxa/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Neoxa Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------
Neoxa Core is dedicated to ensure all new updates that are released will be thoroughly tested before entering the mainnet, this is why we have a testnet running alongside our main chain. While the testnet is running we will regularly run unit_testing that is built into Neoxa Core and ensure all reports come back as PASSED.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
